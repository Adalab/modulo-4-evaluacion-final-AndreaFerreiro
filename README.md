# Summary

I have been asked to create the back-end code for a recipes web.
The back-end part is located in the src folder with its main file "index.js".
In the file, you will find five endpoints, each one with his own fuction: first for select all the recipes in the database; secondone to select only one recipe by using the "id"; the thirdone to change information of one recipe also selected by "id"; Next one is for add a new recipe to the database; and the last one is for delete one, also selected by "id".
All data is stored in a FreeDB database, which I have worked on connected through MySQL Workbench,
